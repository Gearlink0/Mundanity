  "Description": "The Eaters built many great and terrible things, but not all of them are immediately useful to a glory hungry cave-delver.\r\n \r\nAdds artifacts of mundane, domestic life to the game as scrap. These scrap artifacts can be disassembled for bits, or traded, being a little more valuable than typical scrap. A few of these items have some small functionality that isn't really useful to adventuring but could be fun. Though they do not have data disks, you can learn to craft them using other methods.\r\n\r\nThe mod adds the following items\r\n•\tculinary cyst.\r\n•\tmood lenses. Can be worn to recolor your play area.\r\n•\tscouring gel. Can be used to clean your items.\r\n•\tuniversal link.\r\n•\tmotorized sponge. Can be used to clean your items.\r\n•\tetching stylus.\r\n•\torbsinger.\r\n•\tstasis torque.\r\n•\tmodular instrument.\r\n•\tendless puzzle. Can be solved repeatedly to amuse yourself.\r\n•\tlaser scaper. Fires non-damaging laser projectiles that report the size and distance of the target\r\n•\taro-matic.\r\n•\tpigment breeder. Can be used to draw pictures.\r\n•\trelaxation sand.\r\n•\tlaser scale. Fires non-damaging laser projectiles that report the weight of the target.\r\n•\tportable sculpture. Can scan an item in your inventory or a nearby tile to take on the target's appearance.\r\n•\toral implement. \r\n•\tcomplete codex. Can be read, showing a page of Markov text.\r\n•\tstellar memory.\r\n•\tfrozen joy.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this little thing I made.\r\n\r\nThe code is stored on [url=https://github.com/Gearlink0/Mundanity]Github[/url], if you are interested.\r\n\r\nIn the future I might add some small function to the items that don't have one yet if I can think of something good.",
